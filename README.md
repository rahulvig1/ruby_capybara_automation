# ruby_capybara_automation

Ruby capybara automation code for general purpose usage and support the youtube video

The project will be dynamic and I am planning to add a lot many things to things in this project that may or may not be covered as part of the youtube videos.


To run the only test run 'cucumber' from the repository.
